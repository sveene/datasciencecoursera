## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. 
## For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
## This assignment contains two functions overall. One is makeCacheMatrix and the other is cacheSolve

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
   inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinv <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setinv = setinv, getinv = getinv)
}	


## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'	        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  inv <- x$getinv()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached result")
    return(inv)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinv(inv)
  inv
}
